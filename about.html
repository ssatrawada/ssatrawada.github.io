			  	<p id="p01"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very young, when I knew that I loved art. I drew at every opportunity I had and it quickly became my way of expressing myself and communicating with the world. I started oil painting in my teens under the guidance of a teacher from the J.J. School of Arts.   I painted landscapes, seascapes, and portraits. I also learned charcoal and pencil shading. </p>

			  	<p id="p01">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love for teaching  started in 2007 when I  started teaching my own daughter to draw and paint. Passing on all I had learned whatâ€™s beyond rewarding. Today, I am on my 12th year of teaching and teach 30 - 40 kids every week.  Come and join me to learn about drawing, pencil shading, charcoal shading, oil pastels, water colors, and acrylic painting!!! <p>
